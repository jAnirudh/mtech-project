\chapter{The Distributed Contact Discrete Element Method}

The Distributed Contact Discrete Element Method (DCDEM) \cite{canelas} is a variation of the Discrete Element Method wherein the \textbf{Contact Forces }$F^t_i$  acting on the $i^{th}$ particle due to collision with the $j^{th}$ particle is decomposed into \textbf{Normal and Tangential components}  $F_n$ and $F_t$ respectively. Both $F_n$ and $F_t$ are further resolved as \textbf{Repulsive and Dissipative forces},  $F^r$ and $F^d$, coming into existence due to the deformation of the material and the dissipation of energy during the deformation respectively. The DEM mechanisms in two interacting particles is as shown in Figure \ref{fig:dem_mechanism}.

The Normal Contact forces are given by a modified, non-linear Hertzian model as:

\begin{eqnarray}
{\bf{F}} = {\bf{F}}_n^r + {\bf{F}}_n^d = k_{n,ij}~\delta _{ij}^{3/2}~{\bf{e_{ij}}} - \gamma _{n,ij} ~ \delta _{ij}^{1/4} \dot{\delta _{ij}}~\bf{e_{ij}}  
\end{eqnarray}

{\raggedright{where,}}\\
$k_{n,ij} = $ Normal Stiffness Constant of the pair \textit{ij}\\
$\gamma _{n,ij} = $ Normal Damping Constant\\
$\delta _{ij} = $ Particle Overlap $= max(0, \frac{(d_i + d_j)}{2} - {\bf{|{\it{r_{ij}}}|}})$, $d_i, d_j = $ Particle diameter\\
${\bf{e_{ij}}} = $ Unit vector between two mass centers\\
$\dot{\delta _{ij}} = $ Rate of Normal Deformation $= \vec{\it{v_{ij}}}\cdot {\bf{e_{ij}}}$\\

The Stiffness and Damping constants are expressed in terms of the Young's Modulus $E$, Poisson's Ratio $\nu$ and the masses of the $i^{th}$ and $j^{th}$ as:

\begin{eqnarray}
 k_{n,ij} = \frac{4}{3} E^* \sqrt{R^*} \hspace{0.375cm} ; \hspace{0.375cm} \gamma _{n,ij} = C_n \sqrt{6M^*E^* \sqrt{R^*}}
\end{eqnarray}

{\raggedright{where,}}\\
$\frac{1}{E^*} = \frac{1-\nu_I^2}{E_I}+\frac{1-\nu_I^2}{E_I}$ \hspace{0.375cm} ; \hspace{0.375cm} $R^* = \frac{r_i r_j}{r_i + r_j}$ \hspace{0.375cm} ; \hspace{0.375cm} $M^* = \frac{m_I m_J}{m_i + m_j}$\\
with $C_n$ of the order of $10^{-5}$\\


The Tangential Contact Forces are given by Linear Hertzian model bounded by a modified Coulomb Friction Law; the Coulomb Friction Law is modified by means of a sigmoidal function to account for the discontinuity coming into existence when the tangential velocity of the interacting bodies is zero\cite{vetsch}. The model is given as:

\begin{eqnarray}
 {\bf{F}}_{t,ij} = min(\mu_{f,IJ} {\bf{F}}_{n,ij}\tanh(8\dot{\delta^t_{ij}}){\bf{e^t_{ij}}}~; {\bf{F}}_t^r + {\bf{F}}_t^d)
\end{eqnarray}

\hspace{3.15cm}with,

\begin{eqnarray}
 {\bf{F}}_t^r + {\bf{F}}_t^d = k_{t,ij}~\delta^t_{ij}~{\bf{e^t_{ij}}} - \gamma _{t,ij} ~ \dot{\delta ^t_{ij}}~\bf{e^t_{ij}}
\end{eqnarray}

{\raggedright{where,}}\\
$\mu_{f,IJ} = $Coefficient of Kinetic Friction between interacting bodies I and J\\
$\delta^t_{ij} = $ Particle Overlap for Tangential interaction \\
${\bf{e^t_{ij}}} = $ Unit Vector of tangential component of relative velocity perpendicular to $F_n$\cite{vetsch}\\
$k_{t,ij} = $ Tangential Stiffness Constant $= \frac{2}{7} k_{n,ij}$ \cite{hooman}\\
$\gamma_{t,ij} = $ Tangential Damping Constant $=\frac{2}{7} \gamma_{n,ij}$\cite{canelas_thesis}\\
$\dot{\delta ^t_{ij}} = $ Rate of Tangential deformation \\

Since this work makes use of the particle approximation of the SPH method, particle overlap in either the normal or the tangential should be given by the same form; $\dot{\delta ^t_{ij}}$, however, was extrapolated from that of $\dot{\delta _{ij}}$. Thus, the values of the  $\delta^t_{ij}$ and $\dot{\delta ^t_{ij}}$ were taken to be equal to $\delta_{ij}$ and $ \vec{\it{v^t_{ij}}}\cdot {\bf{e_{ij}}}$ respectively. Based on the definition, ${\bf{e^t_{ij}}} = \vec{v_{ij}} - \frac{(\vec{v_{ij}} \cdot \vec{F_{n,ij}}) \vec{F_{n,ij}}}{(|\vec{F_{n,ij}}|^2)}$.

\section{PySPH Implementation}

\subsection{Data Structures and Software Constructs}
As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:pysph_abstractions}, the particle containers can be given additional properties based on the specific requirements of the problem. These are supplied as a ``constants'' dictionary with the keys as the property names and the values as a numpy array. This mechanism is used to provide physical properties such as Young's Modulus, Poisson's Ratio and Coefficient of Kinetic Friction. Further, since the model requires to calculate ${\bf{e_{ij}}}$, the center of masses of all the entities at the initial state of the system are also provided as constants\footnote[9]{The \lstinline!RigidBodyMoments()! class takes care of the evolution of the system mass centers thereafter}. Additionally, in order to demarcate individual solid bodies, the ``body\_id'' constant array is used. 

The interaction between bodies is divided as ``sources'' and ``destinations'', with the ``sources'' contributing to the overall disturbing force on the system and the  ``destinations'' being subjected to those forces. For implementing the new model, the destinations are additionally equipped with five constant arrays: Fx, Fy, Fz, check\_bit, and Fmag. The roles that these arrays play is listed in Table \ref{tab:dest_array}.

\begin{table}[htb!]

\begin{tabular}{|c|L|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Array Name} & \textbf{Role}\\
             &\\\hline
    Fx       & Array elements hold X Component of Total Collision Force of the destination bodies \\\hline
    Fx       & Array elements hold Y Component of Total Collision Force of the destination bodies \\\hline
    Fx       & Array elements hold Z Component of Total Collision Force of the destination bodies \\\hline
    check\_bit & Binary values of the array elements indicate if the destination body has been considered for force calculation\\\hline
    Fmag     & Magnitude of Maximum Collision Force acting on the destination body \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{\small{Role of Additional Constant Arrays}}
\label{tab:dest_array}
\end{table}

Also, as introduced in section \ref{sec:pysph_abstractions} PySPH has Miscellaneous routines to allow ease in setting up cases and implementing models. These include the \lstinline!loop()! and \lstinline!post_loop()! methods described below:

\begin{itemize}

\item \lstinline!loop()!: This method loops over all the destination array particles ``one by one'' (along with the associated nearest neighbours) in each stage of the integrator step thereby allowing all the necessary force computations on each particle to be performed individually. Each loop cycles through all the 

\item \lstinline!post_loop()!: This method ``loops'' over all the destination array particles ``at once'' in each stage of the integrator step thereby allowing manipulations to all the particles after the individual computations are all completed.
\end{itemize}

The \lstinline!loop()! and \lstinline!post_loop()! methods can take specific arguments as dictated by the physics of the problem. These arguments could be pre-fixed with ``\textbf{s\_}'' and ``\textbf{d\_}'' to associate with the source or destination particle properties. Further, general SPH computations make use of many terms which are common across various domains and are provided as ``Pre-computed Symbols''\footnote[10]{\url{http://pysph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/design/overview.html\#writing-the-equations}} to facilitate easy reuse.

Lastly, as mentioned in Section \ref{sec:pysph_design}, PySPH incorporates Run Time Code Generation (RTCG) to generate C/C++ extensions for all simulations. Therefore, while implementing the model any data structures necessary must be declared such it is parsed and understood by the Cython Code Generator. This can be done by making use of the \lstinline!declare()! function. By default, all explicitly undeclared data structures are treated as pointers to arrays of doubles.
